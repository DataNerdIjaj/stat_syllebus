# Syllabus: Exploratory Data Analysis, Sampling Distributions, and Statistical Methods

## Course Overview
This course introduces students to the principles and techniques of exploratory data analysis (EDA), sampling distributions, statistical methods, classification, statistical machine learning, and unsupervised learning. Students will learn to visualize data, summarize key statistics, and understand how to draw inferences from data.
